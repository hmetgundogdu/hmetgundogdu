### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm Ahmet from Turkey. I'm passionate about programming and technology. I enjoy building simple yet impactful projects, always striving to create something meaningful. Life is short, and while we're here, I believe it's important to leave a positive mark behind.

``` c++
class IMail() {
    public:
      virtual string GetSender() = 0;
      virtual string GetTopic() = 0;
      virtual string GetContext() = 0;
};

class IMailResult {
    public:
        virtual bool IsSuccess() = 0;
};

class MailClientBase {
  protected:
    virtual bool Auth(string host, uint16_t port, string address, string password);
    virtual IMailResult Send(MailBaseClass mail);
};

class YourMailClient : protected MailClientBase {   ...   };
class YourMail : public IMail {  ...  };

assert(!(
	    new YourMailClient("fooBoo", "123456")
	        ->Send(new YourMail("hmetgundogdu@gmail.com", "", nullptr))
	        ->IsSuccess()
	    )
    );

return 0;
```

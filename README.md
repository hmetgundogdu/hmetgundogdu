### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is Ahmet from Turkey, i love programing, tech, and such as things. I had try creating 
simple and special things  and i'm trying. Cause thats the life, we going to die and we try
to leave some things to behind us.

``` c++
class IMail() {
    public:
      virtual string GetSender() = 0;
      virtual string GetTopic() = 0;
      virtual string GetContext() = 0;
};

class IMailResult {
    public:
        virtual bool IsSuccess() = 0;
};

class MailClientBase {
  protected:
    virtual bool Auth(string host, uint16_t port, string address, string password);
    virtual IMailResult Send(MailBaseClass mail);
};

class YourMailClient : protected MailClientBase {   ...   };
class YourMail : public IMail {  ...  };

assert(new YourMailClient("fooBoo", "123456")->Send(new YourMail("hmetgundogdu@gmail.com", "", nullptr))->IsSuccess());

return 0;
```
